00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.440
Hey there.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.840
So we just completed learning bootstrap, so
now we’re going to create a website using

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.800
bootstrap.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.000
And this is the site we’re going to create:
basically a travel website with articles on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.160
various landmarks around the world.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.640
This website consists of the top part, our
menu that is.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.160
And here we have a type of brand for our logo.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.120
So here we’re going to have a menu, here
an input field, and here a submit button so

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.380
that you get contacted after submitting your
phone number.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.140
Here we’re going to have a slider with a
series of images and their respective captions.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.120
Next, we’re going to have a number of postcards,
with descriptions of famous cities and corresponding

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.140
pictures.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.120
And also we’ll have a footer, that’s going
to have the copyright and a contact us button.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.260
So, let’s begin.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.540
We’ll begin by creating a new folder that
we’ll simply call site.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.780
Then open it and create the basic structure
for pretty much any website.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.000
We’ll have one folder called CSS.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.520
Another one that we’ll call images.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.640
And then another one called JS.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.160
Next we need a file called index.html.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.320
For that we open up Sublime, click on File,
New File.
And save.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.080
We save it in the main Site folder as index.html.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.200
Then we need a file for our styles, which
is going to be our style.css file.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.760
And we save that in the CSS folder.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.480
Got that.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.400
Now in index.html let’s set up the basic
mockup.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.680
For that we can just write the exclamation
mark and then hit tab.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.600
As the title we can write: Let’s travel!

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.160
Then we’re going to connect to our styles.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.400
Great.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.020
Now the next thing we need to do is connect
bootstrap.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.000
For that we first of all need to download
it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.360
So let’s go to Google and search for bootstrap
4.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.000
Click on Download Bootstrap.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.120
And then once again Download Bootstrap.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.280
As you see, here we have a file with bootstrap
that just got downloaded.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.400
So here we have our downloaded folder.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.240
And inside there are two more folders: CSS
and JS.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.800
From the CSS folder we need bootstrap.min.css.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.160
We just go ahead and copy it and then paste
it into our CSS folder.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.080
We also need JS.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.960
Why?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.680
Because we’re going to create a slider,
which is going to be done using JavaScript.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.520
So let’s copy bootstrap.min.js and paste
it into the JS folder.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.760
Ok, next we need to connect bootstrap.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.460
So for that, before the style.css we write: link, rel=stylesheet,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.660
and for href we indicate css/bootstrap.min.css.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.180
And let’s also go ahead and connect JS right before the end &lt;body&gt; tag.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.540
For that we write script,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.080
and then as the src we specify the path to our JS file, js/bootstrap.min.js.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.180
But, as we know, to work with bootstrap, we need to connect 2 libraries, namely jQuery and Popper.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.460
So let’s connect these libraries with the help of CDN.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.080
For that, we go to the official bootstrap website.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.900
Scroll down a little bit.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.080
And right here we need this first line which is the jQuery library,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.800
, and the second one which is the Popper library.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.080
Ok, we copy these lines and paste them straight before the bootstrap.min.js.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.920
Ok. Great.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.720
Everything is connected now. Now we can move on to the mockup of the page itself.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.280
As you see, our site consists of three parts: the header, the main part, and then the footer at the bottom.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.320
So we can go ahead and create these three tags: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.280
What do we have in the header?

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.200
If we look at it, this is the common structure for a typical bootstrap navbar.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.880
So let’s go back to the bootstrap 4 website, go to Documentation, and then select Components.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.160
In the Components we look for Navbar.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.480
And as you can see, it’s the same kind of structure.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.920
So we’re just going to copy all of these and then paste it as our header.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720
What are some differences?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.920
First of all, our site isn’t going to be called Navbar, but Let’s travel!

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.880
Next we have the menu with the links to different pages.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.120
First of these is Home, which is the same for our site.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.480
Then after Home, let’s see, we have About us.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.360
So let’s change that.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.920
And finally the last link is Contacts.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.200
If you haven’t noticed, Contacts has a class called disabled.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.720
Which does what?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.880
It creates an inactive link like this one right here.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.640
We don’t need that so we can simply remove disabled.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.000
Next we see that this button right here has a blue color with a blue frame.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.360
But right now we have a green button with a green frame.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.440
How do we change that?

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.920
All we have to do is for this class here that says btn-outline-success,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.040
we need to change the last word to primary.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.320
Also, we need to remove this placeholder here and add our own: so Phone number.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.120
And as the text we will add Call me.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.720
Let’s save and see what it looks like.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:35.000
There. Now our site has a great looking menu, almost just like in the original.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.800
The only difference is that in the original all the content of the navbar is placed within this container.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.600
So we need to create a &lt;div&gt; with a class called container.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.560
And this container is actually going to be placed within the navbar.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.480
Why within?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:05.000
Because if you look at it, here the &lt;nav&gt; itself, it spans the entire width of the page.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So only the content of nav is limited by a width size.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.600
We cut out everything inside the nav tag.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.920
Then we add a container.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.600
And then in this container we paste back what we just cut out.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.600
There.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.560
Let’s refresh the page.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.440
And there we have it. Ok, great.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.000
Moving on. The next thing to do is this slider.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.920
The slider here is also a bootstrap component that’s called a carousel.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.160
So, in Components, locate the carousel element.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.000
And then we look for the same kind of slider that we have.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.560
Ok, so this one already looks kind of similar.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.400
However, on our site we also have the indicators that this one doesn’t have.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.120
And here it is with the indicators.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.680
So we can just copy this block of code here.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.920
And then add it to the &lt;main&gt; tag.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.200
We’ll just add a little comment right before our slider so that we remember what it is.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.960
What does our slider consist of?

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:58.760
It consists of the indicators for the slides and then of the slides themselves contained in this carousel-inner class.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.400
However, even though this structure is very similar to what we need, it’s not identical.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.760
Because if you look at it, we also have these captions

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.040
here with the name of landmark and of the city.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.560
And this slider doesn’t have that.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.240
In order to add the captions, Bootstrap says we need to add this block here, carousel-caption.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.760
So to each of our slides we’re going to add this caption.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.960
The first one, second, and third.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.040
So now let’s take care of the images themselves and their captions.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.320
Along with this exercise, you will get all the images

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.280
and descriptions for the images that are used in this lesson.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.760
It’s specifically in this text file and then the images are in here.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.080
Let’s just go ahead and copy all of our images

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.320
and paste them to our site, specifically to our images folder.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.440
And then the docx file itself we’re just going to open right now.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.480
As you see here, we have Slide 1, Slide 2, and Slide 3.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.040
And then down here we have the texts for the cards.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.320
All these texts that you see here, they’re all taken from Wikipedia.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.040
So you can either use this document or you could go to Wikipedia and get the text there.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.320
So what do we do?

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.200
First of all, let’s indicate the paths to all of the images.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.320
Here is our first image,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.520
so we write the path as images/slider-1.jpg.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.600
Then our second image, which is going to be images/slider-2.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.720
And then the third image is images/slider-3.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.080
Then we got our captions.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.800
The first caption is Golden Gate bridge.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.120
So let’s paste that here as the header.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.360
And as for the &lt;p&gt; tag we paste here the city where the landmark is in.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.480
Then we got Niagara Falls.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.920
And Niagara Falls happens to be in two places at the same time.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.920
And finally we got Stonehenge,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.480
and then where it’s located.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.840
So let’s see what we have so far.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.080
So here we have our slider.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.040
But as you see, like the nav, it’s positioned at the beginning of the page.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.720
So then, all the content of the main tag, we’re going to wrap in a container class.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.520
So everything that’s in the main tag, we can cut for now.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.440
Create a &lt;div&gt; with class container,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.640
and then paste it back.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.240
Refresh

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.400
and now we see that it shifted over.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.600
Ok, next.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Next we have the cards themselves.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.160
We have 6 of them.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.680
These are actually using the bootstrap grid, so that means that each of these cards

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.320
takes up 4 bootstrap columns, because 12 divided by 3 is 4.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.440
So what do we do?

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.240
After our slider inside the container, let’s create a new comment.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.600
Let it just say Cards.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.720
And here we’re going to create a row, and this is where we’re going to add our cards.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.520
Every card is a col-4, and we have 6 of these.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.880
What’s the inner structure of each card?

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.760
The structure is going to be standard for all the cards that we’ve seen, and it’s going to look like the following.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720
First we have a &lt;div&gt; with class card.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.240
And then inside that we’ll have two parts:

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.960
first the image that’s at the top, so we’re going to call it card-image-top,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.120
and the second part is card-body, the lower part of the card.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.200
So let’s create an &lt;img&gt; with class card-img-top.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.240
Go ahead and specify the path:

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
images/img-1.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.520
Alt is going to be the same everywhere: Card image.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.040
And then under the image we’re going to have a card body.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
What does the card body consist of?

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.760
It consists of a header, some regular text, and a Details button.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.480
So inside card-body we’re going to create three elements.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.760
The first is card-title, which is going to be an &lt;h4&gt; by the way.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.320
Then a &lt;p&gt; tag with class card-text.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.400
Then lastly a &lt;button&gt; with class btn

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.800
and another class btn-primary – primary, because it’s blue.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.280
Ok, so the title for the first card is Eiffel Tower.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.920
But before copy pasting that, let’s generate five more of these card structures,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.760
so that we don’t have to do them over each time.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.680
So we just paste them into each of these col-4s.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.360
And now we can add the first title.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.200
And also add the text.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.320
And in all cases the button says Details. So let’s just add that everywhere right now.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.280
Ok, now onto the second landmark.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.320
Here the image path needs to change to img-2.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.120
The title is Big Ben.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.840
And here’s the description.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.280
The third image is the Statue of Liberty.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.320
And here’s the description.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.800
So with the fourth card it’s img-4.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.960
Sydney Opera House.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.560
And the title description.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.160
On to the fifth card img-5.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.360
The description.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.400
And the 6th card.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.800
And there we have it.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.680
So let’s save all this and see what we have.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.400
And you see we’ve got what we needed.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:27.080
But if you look at the original, you will see that here we’ve got some spacing in all these areas.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.560
And the same amount of spacing up here between the header and the slider.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.000
So let’s add here another class called mt-20, which means margin-top: 20.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.200
And we’ll add that same class to the slider.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:04.880
And then in CSS we just write mt-20, margin-top: 20px.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.840
Refresh.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.760
And now we’ve got the margins just like we needed.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.760
Great. So we’ve taken care of all that.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.320
Next, we have our footer.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.400
So the footer has the same background color as the header, if you look at it.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.920
So for the footer we’re going to add a class that’s going to create the same kind of background.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320
What does the footer consist of?

00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:00.880
The footer has two parts: first is the copyright, and then the Contact Us button.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.880
So since it’s divided into two parts, first we’re going to add a container that’s going to limit the width.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.400
Then inside the container we add a row.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.040
And then inside the row: col-6*2.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.840
In the first one we’ll have our copyright.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.320
So tag p with class copy, for example.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.640
And as the text, just copy this thing.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.720
And then in the other col-6 we will have a button.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.640
Button with class btn. And since it’s blue, btn-primary.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.560
Let’s open our page to see what we’ve got.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.200
Here’s our copyright. And here’s our button.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.000
But since we didn’t add any text, it’s just a blue button.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.840
So let’s add to it: Contact Us.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.520
Save.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.680
And there’s our button.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:44.160
So, as you see, by default the button positions itself beginning from the left side.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.560
So since we have two columns, the second column starts somewhere here

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.920
and that’s exactly where our button is.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.240
So to get it to the right side, we’re going to use some standard flexbox classes

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.240
that became available with bootstrap 4.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:05.960
So for col-6 let’s add a class d-flex so that we know that this element will be displayed as flex.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.040
Then we need to specify that this element has to be aligned to the right.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.760
So for that let’s add class justify-content-end.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:36.520
And also, this button is aligned vertically to the center and that’s why we will add align-items-center.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.720
And the copyright here, All Rights Reserved,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.320
also needs to be aligned vertically towards the center.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.000
So let’s copy all these classes and add them to this col-6.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.560
But we will remove this class, because by default it gets aligned

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.480
to the left, and that’s actually what we want for our copyright.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.600
Let’s see what we have now.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.520
Button’s on the right and copyright is on the left.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:19.960
Perfect.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:27.320
Next, we see that the footer has small height, its height actually equals the height of the content inside.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.800
So what do we need to write?

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.680
We need to add that the footer should have a height of somewhere about 80px.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.600
And it also has a margin on the top of around 50px.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:03.560
And here – it already has a decent height, but the copyright and Contact Us didn’t get vertically aligned.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.520
Why is that?

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.520
If we open the Inspector,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.400
you will see that class container, that’s inside the footer,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.480
it has a limited height – specifically the height of its content.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.680
So we need to set it so that its height equals that of its parent.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.080
Same thing with class row, by the way, - its height also equals that of its content.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:38.960
So to fix that, we need to add that footer&gt;.container, and also footer .row have a height of 100%.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.040
How is it that we can just write 100%?

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.360
Because we already gave our footer a fixed height.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:07.040
So these 100% will mean 100% of these 80px, so 80px in other words.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.080
And now if we refresh the page,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.680
you will see that it’s all centered now.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.240
What do we have left to do?

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.080
We still need this popup window that appears when we click on the Contact Us button.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.760
So, in order to get this window to work, we once again head over to the bootstrap window

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.760
and look for the component called modal.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.080
We just need the most basic version of it, this one right here.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.040
And in the modal body we will add everything we need.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.000
Specifically, we need a form to go here.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.800
So let’s copy this entire block.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.280
And paste it right after &lt;main&gt;.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.440
We will also add a comment to make things more clear.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.640
And now let’s make some changes.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.560
First of all, what should our title be?

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.440
Let’s see.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.440
Contact Us.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.400
And then in the body we’ll have a form.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.240
So let’s find the form component on bootstrap.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.400
And here’s a general form, from which we can pick and choose what we need.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.720
As you can see, the form consists of a number of form groups:

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.600
here’s one form group, here’s another one, and so on.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.840
So this, this, and this – these are all form groups.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.600
So we’re just going to use those form groups that we need.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.920
We probably want this first one.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.160
So let’s go ahead and add that one right now.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.920
Then instead of Email Address, let’s add Your name.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.560
So let’s change the value of the “for” attribute to name, and we also need to change the id to name.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.040
Then the type isn’t email, but text.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.160
As the placeholder let’s have Name.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.960
Next we have the Phone number.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.960
The phone number has the same structure as the name, so we can just copy it.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.800
And then of course for the label we’re going to have Phone number instead.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.840
“For” will be phone.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.280
ID should also be phone then.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.200
And as the placeholder, phone.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.640
And the third part is the message field.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800
So this is going to be a textarea.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.640
So here’s a textarea. And this is the structure for a textarea.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.760
So let’s copy it. Paste it underneath.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.600
Change this to Message.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.960
ID will be message.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.040
There. Got it. Let’s check to see if it works.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.680
And, as expected, it doesn’t. Why’s that?

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.320
Because we didn’t specify which form here is supposed to bring up this button.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.120
And since the form is hidden by default, we don’t see it.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.960
So to make it work, let’s go back to our modal component.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.000
And here you can find the code needed for the button to work.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.280
And from here what do we need to add to our button?

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.040
We need to add these two attributes: data-toggle= “modal” and data-target.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.760
And for data-target we’re going to specify the ID of our form.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.360
So let’s copy this.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.360
Here’s our footer. And here’s the button that should bring the form up.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.720
So here we add data-toggle and data-target.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.320
So instead of exampleModal, let’s change the id to myModal.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.880
And then for the modal window itself we’ll add id=”myModal.”

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.880
And now let’s check it.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.400
And indeed it works.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:53.320
The only thing left is to change these two buttons – Save changes and Close – to only one button, Submit.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.960
So here in the modal block, we can delete this entire thing.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.160
And instead, inside the form we’ll add an input of type submit.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:22.160
And for the class we will add btn and btn-primary to display it as a blue button.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.360
Let’s save.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.400
And there’s our button.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.240
And there we have it!

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.960
My congratulations! Now you know how to create a nice little website in half an hour.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.240
That’s it for now. Till next time.
